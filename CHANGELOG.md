# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.1.0-dev

- Recover the original local bootstrap and establish the public GitHub project.
- Replace regex JS/TS extraction with TypeScript AST scanning.
- Require explicit requirement-to-command evidence bindings.
- Add a runtime-validated ProofPack v1 contract, generated public JSON Schema, and compatibility fixture.
- Resolve TypeScript aliases, NodeNext references and local workspace imports; report unresolved imports explicitly.
- Reconstruct deleted JS/TS symbols from HEAD or an explicit base ref in change summaries and ProofPacks.
- Parse Node JUnit evidence and bind requirements to exact passing testcase names; reject empty, skipped, failed, duplicate, unrelated, or malformed reports.
- Bind evidence to one run, Git HEAD and repository content; refuse stale/mutating runs.
- Bound output and execution time, and isolate child commands from Node test-worker context.
- Validate contracts and intent ids; preserve config on repeated initialization.
- Use the official MCP SDK; require operator opt-in for execution.
- Add CI, lockfile, consumer packaging checks and a root composite Action.
- Publish a byte-reproducible preview tarball from CI and test both blocked and trusted Action paths.
- Test the CLI/core on Linux, macOS and Windows and document the narrower Action/package support boundary.
- Enforce a versioned Project Constitution with dependency-boundary and sensitive-path evidence rules.
- Add Python 3 AST scanning, local import resolution, unresolved-module diagnostics and structured pytest JUnit evidence. ProofPack v1 remains version 1; `pytest-junit` is an additive provider value and existing Node artifacts remain valid.
- Replace the unsafe pre-v1 provider placeholder with `projectmind.provider/v1`: providers contribute schema-validated commands while ProjectMind alone executes commands and creates evidence/verdicts. Add a packaged Git diff example provider.
- Add a reusable generic MCP stdio compatibility pilot, Claude-style `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` root handling, server instructions, and a tested project-scoped Claude Code config example. An authenticated interactive Claude Code session remains an explicit pending pilot.
- Add the first real-repository pilot: checked-in configuration, Constitution and exact-test intent let ProjectMind verify its own trust boundaries in CI and publish the resulting ProofPack artifact.
- Add a fail-closed stable-release readiness check, publication checklist, complete npm metadata, package-name-independent smoke imports, and declaration-file-safe TypeScript scanning.
- Add a deterministic, network-free demo runner and tested recording storyboard for the complete `NOT_VERIFIED → VERIFIED → NOT_VERIFIED` trust-gate flow.
- Add Engineering Memory Lite with versioned local decision/constraint/incident records, deterministic ranked retrieval, CLI recall, and a read-only MCP search tool.
- Document trust limits and scope the roadmap to the v0.3 application candidate.

No stable release has occurred. The first public development preview is available as `@callabens/projectmind@0.1.0-dev.1` on npm.

The manifest is prepared for the first reviewed `0.1.0-dev.1` preview as `@callabens/projectmind` on the non-default `next` npm tag. This does not mark a stable release.
